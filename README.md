Music CRUD website 

Music Collector!

A site which is aimed at providing CRUD functionality with a fun twist.

the site allows users to create a 'collection' think of it as a list of songs, the user can name these 'collection' anything they like.

once created, the user can then add their favourite songs, both the collection itself and the individual songs within those collections are saved to mongoDB.

Users can Create Collections, with which they can store any music they want so long as they provide the following;
-Song Name
-Artist or band that made the song
-Genre it belongs to

once that information is given, the song is stored with the collection in the mongoDB database


Users can then view the collections which they make, each one is independent and stores its own songs

if a user wanted to, they can also add more songs or delete songs from the collections if they so choose


Users can also delete entire collections if they so choose


the site has three main pages

The landing page, which is the same page where users can view their collections

a 'Create Collection page, where users can create their collection by giving it a name and then pressing the 'Create Music Collection' button

and finally the about section, which just gives a very brief summary of what the site can do


the site has a very simple layout, and makes use of some stylistic choices to make it a bit more appealing to interact with, such as the use of gradient for the background and the use of icons where possible to make the site more interesting to interact with and look at


have fun using Music Collector!
